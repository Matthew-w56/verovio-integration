# Verovio Integration

A Proof-Of-Concept program to show that Verovio can be imported into a Flutter Dart program, as well as a concrete example of how that would be done.

## Running (_IMPORTANT!_)

This program will not compile and run out of the box.  The program relies on the library being built on your machine, and installed.  To get that done quickly, follow the instructions in the file [Found Here](./lib/verovio/InstallingVerovio.md).

## Using Verovio in Your Own Project

To use Verovio in your own project, all you need to do is follow the steps in the previously linked file, which lines out how to install Verovio into your system.  Then, copy over all the files in the /lib/verovio/ directory into your project.  Making sure you use the same path will cut down on the number of places that you need to change a path, but it's free to go wherever.  Then just use the [API class](./lib/verovio/verovio_api.dart)
