# Verovio Integration

A Proof-Of-Concept program to show that Verovio can be imported into a Flutter Dart program, as well as a visual example of how that would be done.

## Running (_IMPORTANT!_)

This program will not compile and run out of the box.  The program relies on the library being built on your machine, and installed.  To get that done quickly, follow the instructions in the file [Found Here](./InstallingVerovio.md).
